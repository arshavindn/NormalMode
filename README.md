Open any file in NORMAL (Readonly) mode. This plugin based on Toggle the View Read-Only and inspired by Vim's normal mode.

## Installation
Install this repository via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
Or put the files into a directory in your {sublime}\Data\Packages\ folder

## Usage
You have a context-menu on:
- the tab
- and direct in the edit area.

The default shortcut:
"i" + "i"

You can toggle via context-menus or shortcut or commnad pallate.
If you toggle the normal mode, the status changes from NORMAL to INSERT or backwards.

This tool doesn't change the file properties in the filesystem. It only changes the readonly attribute of the current view.
